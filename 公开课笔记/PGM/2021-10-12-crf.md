## Q about CRF?

1.   difference btw **CRF** & deterministic classifier, as they both model $P(Y|\bold{X})$?

     -   as mentioned in the class , training an classifier such as SVM, booster, what's the relation to **CRF**?

2.   How to compute the normalization factors in CRF?

3.   as said, CRF is normalized differently than a Naive bayers, does that indicate:

     CRF is a deterministic model $P(Y | \bold{X})$vs. NB as a generative model ($P(\bold{X}, Y)$)
