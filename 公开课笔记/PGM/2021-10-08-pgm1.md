## 2 types

-   DAG： Baysian Networks
-   UG： Markov Networks



## Factors

-   mapping, Scope
-   Factor Product
-   Factor Marginalization
-   Factor Conditioning
-   **High Demensional Space** can be viewed as **factor product of low-dim** space probablistic distributions

## Baysian Nets

-   Joint probability of a series of conditioning probabilities
-   Chain rule of BN:
    -   is a factor product
    -   Proof: BN is a valid probablity distribution
        1.   P > 0 $\rightarrow$ True because its a factor product
        2.   $P(X_1X_2...X_n) = \sum_{X_1X_2...X_n}\prod{Par(X_i)} = 1$
             -   Useful tricks: Pushing $\sum_{var_i}$ into $\prod$ conditioning probability(abbr. **CPD**), hence canceled (CPD sum = 1)

### E6-Reasoning Patterns

#### 1. Causal reasoning

child prob conditioned on parents observed $P(child_l| {par_i, par_j, ...})$

#### 2. Evidential reasoning

children 2 ancestors

#### 3. Intercausal Reasoning

-   conditioning on contexts where **no explicit edges** existed
-   **Explaining Away**： multiple causes(parent nodes)
-   example $ Y = X_1 \space OR \space X_2$
    -   **Given a value of** **Y** (Evidence node or any ancestors),  $X_1$ not independent from $X_2 $,  i.e. ($P(X_1 | X_2 = v) \neq P(X_1) $

-   *Inference flow*

### E7-Flow of probablistic distribution

-   Influence: change of belief on nodes

-   V-structures (blocks if no evidence is given)
-   Active Trails
    -   V-structure valves open (evidence nodes or its ancestors have to be in the evidence set)
    -   Other node valves in the trail open (**no** nodes are in the evidence set)

### E-8 Conditional Independence

-   Complementary View to factor product: High Dim Space as a representation of **the set of independences** that the probablistic distribution must satisfy

-   3 ways of defining **Independence** (in terms of events & random variables)
    -   Note: event = an *observed* value set of random varibales
    -   Joint Prob: viewed as low demensional factor product
    -   Flow of influcence : universal defination over all possible events
    -   (Symmetricity of influence flow)

-   Conditional Independence
